features:
  - OpenStack-Ansible now supports the openSUSE Leap 42.X
    distributions mainly targeting the latest 42.3 release.
issues:
  - Ceph storage backend is known not to work on openSUSE
    Leap 42.X yet. This is due to missing openSUSE support
    in the upstream Ceph Ansible playbooks.
other:
  - openSUSE Leap 42.X support is still work in progress and
    not fully tested besides basic coverange in the OpenStack CI and
    individual manual testing. Even though backporting fixes to the
    Pike release will be done on best effort basis, it's advised to
    use the master branch when working on openSUSE hosts.
