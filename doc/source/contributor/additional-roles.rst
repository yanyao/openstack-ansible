==================================
Contributing to Roles and Services
==================================

If you would like to contribute towards a role to introduce an OpenStack
or infrastructure service, or to improve an existing role, the
OpenStack-Ansible project would welcome that contribution and your assistance
in maintaining it.

Recommended procedure to develop a role
---------------------------------------

#. Deploy OpenStack-Ansible (possibly using
   `an AIO`_
   deploy) so that you have the rest of an OpenStack cluster to integrate with
   in your testing.
#. Deploy your service on another VM, or possibly directly on the AIO host, by
   hand. Configure the service to coordinate with the OpenStack cluster
   appropriately. When all the related systems are communicating with each
   other you can use the resulting configuration as a reference later.
#. Develop a role for your service. A recommended process is detailed below.

.. _an AIO: quickstart-aio.html

Writing a new role
------------------

Here are the steps to write the role:

#. You can review roles which may be currently in development by checking our
   `specs repository`_ and `unmerged specs`_ on review.openstack.org. If you
   do not find a spec for the role, propose a blueprint/spec `(see also the
   spec template)`_ outlining the new Role. By proposing a draft spec you can
   help the OpenStack-Ansible community keep track of what roles are being
   developed and perhaps connect you with others who may be interested and
   able to help you in the process.
#. Create a source repository (e.g. on Github) to start your work on the Role.
#. Generate the reference directory structure for an Ansible role which is
   the necessary subset of the documented `Best Practice`_. You might use
   Ansible Galaxy tools to do this for you (e.g. ``ansible-galaxy init``).
   You may additionally want to include directories such as ``docs`` and
   ``examples`` and ``tests`` for your role.
#. Generate a meta/main.yml right away. This file is important to Ansible to
   ensure your dependent roles are installed and available and provides others
   with the information they will need to understand the purpose of your role.

#. Develop task files for each of the install stages in turn, creating any
   handlers and templates as needed. Ensure that you notify handlers after any
   task which impacts the way the service would run (such as configuration
   file modifications). Also take care that file ownership and permissions are
   appropriate.

   .. HINT:: Fill in variable defaults, libraries, and prerequisites as you
      discover a need for them. You can also develop documentation for your
      role at the same time.

#. Add tests to the role.
#. Ensuring the role deploys with an AIO.

Writing tasks in a role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most OpenStack services will follow a common series of stages to install or
update a service deployment. This is apparent when you review `tasks/main.yml`
for existing roles.

#. pre-install: prepare the service user group and filesystem directory paths
   on the host or container
#. install: install system packages, prepare the (optional) service virtual
   environment, install service and requirements (into a virtual environment)
#. post-install: apply all configuration files
#. service add: register the service (each of: service type, service project,
   service user, and endpoints) within Keystone's service catalog.
#. service setup: install a service-startup script (init, upstart, systemd,
   etc.) so that the service will start up when the container or host next
   starts.
#. service init/startup: signal to the host or container to start the services,
   make sure the service runs on boot.

There may be other specialized steps required by some services but most of the
roles will perform all of these at a minimum. Begin by reviewing a role for a
service that has something in common with your service and think about how you
can fit most of the common service setup and configuration steps into that
model.

.. HINT:: Following the patterns you find in other roles can help ensure your role
   is easier to use and maintain.

Keep in mind a role candidate for inclusion should respect our
`Ansible Style Guide`_.

.. _Ansible Style Guide: contribute.html#ansible-style-guide

Adding tests to a role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each of the role tests is in its tests/ folder.

This folder contains at least the following files:

#. ``test.yml`` ("super" playbook acting as test router to sub-playbooks)
#. ``<role name>-overrides.yml``. This var file is automatically loaded
   by our shell script in our `tests repository`_.
#. ``inventory``. A static inventory for role testing.
   It's possible some roles have multiple inventories. See for example the
   neutron role with its ``lxb_inventory``, ``calico_inventory``.
#. ``group_vars`` and ``host_vars``. These folders will hold override the
   necessary files for testing. For example, this is where you override
   the IP addresses, IP ranges, and ansible connection details.
#. ``ansible-role-requirements.yml``. This should be fairly straightforward:
   this file contains all the roles to clone before running your role.
   The roles' relative playbooks will have to be listed in the ``test.yml``
   file. However, keep in mind to NOT re-invent the wheel. For example,
   if your role needs keystone, you don't need to create your own keystone
   install playbook, because we have a generic keystone install playbook
   in the `tests repository`.

.. _tests repository: https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/openstack-ansible-tests

Deploying the role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Include your role on the deploy host. See also `Adding Galaxy roles`_.
#. Perform any other host preparation (such as the tasks performed by the
   ``bootstrap-aio.yml`` playbook). This includes any preparation tasks that
   are particular to your service.
#. Generate files to include your service in the Ansible inventory
   using `env.d`_ and `conf.d`_ files for use on your deploy host.

   .. HINT:: You can follow examples from other roles, making the appropriate
      modifications being sure that group labels in ``env.d`` and ``conf.d``
      files are consistent.

#. Generate secrets, if any, as described in the :deploy_guide:`Configure
   Service Credentials <configure.html#configuring-service-credentials>`.
   You can append your keys to an existing ``user_secrets.yml`` file or add a
   new file to the ``openstack_deploy`` directory to contain them. Provide
   overrides for any other variables you will need at this time as well, either
   in ``user_variables.yml`` or another file. This is explained in more depth
   under `Extending OpenStack-Ansible`_.
#. If your service is installed from source or relies on python packages which
   need to be installed from source, specify a repository for the source
   code of each requirement by adding a file to your deploy host under
   ``playbooks/defaults/repo_packages`` in the OpenStack-Ansible source
   repository and following the pattern of files currently in that directory.
   You could also simply add an entry to an existing file there. Be sure to
   run the ``repo-build.yml`` play later so that wheels for your packages will
   be included in the repository infrastructure.
#. Make any required adjustments to the load balancer configuration
   (e.g. modify ``playbooks/inventory/group_vars/all/haproxy.yml`` in the
   OpenStack-Ansible source repository on your deploy host) so that your
   service can be reached through a load balancer, if appropriate, and be sure
   to run the ``haproxy-install.yml`` play later so your changes will be
   applied. Please note, you can also use ``haproxy_extra_services`` variable
   if you don't want to provide your service as default for everyone.
#. Put together a service install playbook file for your role. This can also
   be modeled from any existing service playbook that has similar
   dependencies to your service (database, messaging, storage drivers,
   container mount points, etc.). A common place to keep playbook files in a
   Galaxy role is in an ``examples`` directory off the root of the role.

.. HINT:: If you adhere to the pattern of isolating your role's extra
   deployment requirements (secrets and var files, HAProxy yml fragments,
   repo_package files, etc.) in their own files it makes it easy for you to
   automate these additional steps when testing your role.

Role development maturity
-------------------------
In order to include a role into the integrated build implemented by the
playbooks in the ``openstack/openstack-ansible`` repository, it needs to
meet an appropriate level of maturity requirements. Developers are
encouraged to observe the below-mentioned patterns in the existing roles.

.. note::
   Many of the existing roles may not fully implement all the patterns
   just yet. It is important to look through multiple roles to get an
   idea of the common patterns rather than to fixate on a single role's
   pattern. Another good place to look is `role maturity table`_.

.. _role maturity table: role-maturity.html

The development of a role will usually go through the following stages:

#. Initial role development

   * Include base scaffolding. To facilitate development and the tests
     implemented across all OpenStack-Ansible roles, a base set of folders
     and files need to be implemented. A base set of configuration and test
     facilitation scripts must include at least the following:

     * ``tox.ini``:
       The lint testing, documentation build, release notes build and
       functional build execution process for the role's gate tests are all
       defined in this file.
     * ``test-requirements.txt``:
       The python requirements which must be installed when executing the
       tests.
     * ``other-requirements.txt``:
       The binary requirements which must be installed on the host the tests
       are executed on for the python requirements and the tox execution to
       work.
     * ``setup.cfg`` and ``setup.py``:
       Information about the repository which is used during the build of any
       artifacts.
     * ``run_tests.sh``:
       A convenient script for developers to execute all standard tests on a
       suitable host.
     * ``Vagrantfile``:
       A convenient configuration file to allow a developer to easily create a
       test virtual machine using `Vagrant`_. This must automatically execute
       ``run_tests.sh``.
     * ``README.rst``, ``LICENSE``, ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``:
       A set of standard files which have content describing their purpose.
     * ``.gitignore``:
       A standard git configuration file for the repository which should be
       pretty uniform across all the repositories.
     * ``.gitreview``:
       A standard file configured for the project to inform the ``git-review``
       plugin where to find the upstream gerrit remote for the repository.

   * The role development should initially be focused on implementing a set of
     tasks and a test playbook which converge. The convergence must:

     * Implement ``developer_mode`` to build from a git source into a Python
       venv.
     * Deploy the applicable configuration files in the right places.
     * Ensure that the service starts.

     The convergence may involve consuming other OpenStack-Ansible roles (For
     example: ``galera_server``, ``galera_client``, ``rabbitmq_server``) in
     order to ensure that the appropriate infrastructure is in place. Reuse
     of existing roles in OpenStack-Ansible or Ansible Galaxy is strongly
     encouraged.

   * The role *must* support Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. It should
     ideally also support CentOS 7 and openSUSE 42.X but this is not required
     at this time. The patterns to achieve this include:

     * The separation of platform specific variables into role vars files.
     * The detection and handling of different init systems (init.d, SystemD).
     * The detection and handling of different package managers (apt, yum).
     * The detection and handling of different network configuration methods.

     There are several examples of these patterns implemented across many of
     the OpenStack-Ansible roles. Developers are advised to inspect the
     established patterns and either implement or improve upon them.

   * The role implementation should be done in such a way that it is agnostic
     with regards to whether it is implemented in a container, or on a
     physical host. The test infrastructure may make use of LXC containers for
     the separation of services, but if a role is used by a playbook that
     targets a host, it must work regardless of whether that host is a
     container, a virtual server, or a physical server. The use of LXC
     containers for role tests is not required but it may be useful in order
     to simulate a multi-node build out as part of the testing infrastructure.

   * Any secrets (For example: passwords) should not be provided with default
     values in the tasks, role vars, or role defaults. The tasks should be
     implemented in such a way that any secrets required, but not provided,
     should result in the task execution failure. It is important for a
     secure-by-default implementation to ensure that an environment is not
     vulnerable due to the production use of default secrets. Deployers
     must be forced to properly provide their own secret variable values.

   * Once the initial convergence is working and the services are running,
     the role development should focus on implementing some level of
     functional testing. Ideally, the functional tests for an OpenStack role
     should make use of Tempest to execute the functional tests. The ideal
     tests to execute are scenario tests as they test the functions that
     the service is expected to do in a production deployment. In the absence
     of any scenario tests for the service a fallback option is to implement
     the smoke tests instead.

   * The role must include documentation. The `Documentation and Release Note
     Guidelines`_ provide specific guidelines with regards to style and
     conventions. The documentation must include a description of the
     mandatory infrastructure (For example: a database and a message queue are
     required), variables (For example: the database name and credentials) and
     group names (For example: The role expects a group named ``foo_all`` to
     be present and it expects the host to be a member of it) for the role's
     execution to succeed.

#. Integration development

   Once the role has implemented the above requirements, work can begin on
   integrating the role into the integrated build. This involves the
   preparation of the following items:

   * Host and container group configuration

     This is implemented into the dynamic inventory through the definition of
     content in an ``env.d`` file. A description of how these work can be
     found in :deploy_guide:`Appendix C <app-custom-layouts.html>`
     of the Deployment Guide.

   * Load balancer configuration

     OpenStack-Ansible deploys services in a highly available configuration by
     default, so all API services must be configured for implementation behind
     HAProxy. This is done through the modification of
     ``playbooks/vars/configs/haproxy_config.yml``.

   * Install playbook

     In order to implement the role in the appropriate way, an
     ``os-<service>-install.yml`` playbook must be created and targeted
     at the appropriate group defined in the service ``env.d`` file. The
     playbook should also ensure that the database(s), database user(s),
     rabbitmq vhost and rabbitmq user are setup for the service. It is
     crucial that the implementation of the service is optional and that the
     deployer must opt-in to the deployment through the population of a host
     in the applicable host group. If the host group has no hosts, Ansible
     skips the playbook's tasks automatically.

   * Secrets

     Any secrets required for the role to work must be noted in the
     ``etc/openstack_deploy/user_secrets.yml`` file.

   * Group vars

     Any variables needed by other roles to connect to the new role, or by the
     new role to connect to other roles, should be implemented in
     ``playbooks/inventory/group_vars``. The group vars are essentially the
     glue which playbooks use to ensure that all roles are given the
     appropriate information. When group vars are implemented it should be a
     minimum set to achieve the goal of integrating the new role into the
     integrated build.

   * Documentation

     Content must be added to the Installation Guide to describe how to
     implement the new service in an integrated environment. This content must
     adhere to the `Documentation and Release Note Guidelines`_. Until the
     role has integrated functional testing implemented, the documentation
     must make it clear that the service inclusion in OpenStack-Ansible is
     experimental and is not fully tested by OpenStack-Ansible in an
     integrated build.

   * Release note

     A feature release note must be added to announce the new service
     availability and to refer to the Installation Guide entry and the role
     documentation for further details. This content must adhere to the
     `Documentation and Release Note Guidelines`_.

   * Integration test

     It must be possible to execute a functional, integrated test which
     executes a deployment in the same way as a production environment. The
     test must execute a set of functional tests using Tempest. This is the
     required last step before a service can remove the experimental warning
     from the documentation.
